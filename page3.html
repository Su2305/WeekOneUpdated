    <p>As much as I like a great film, I love to watch documentaries that make you gasp as to how incredulous some people can be.
        Netflix's 'Don't f**k with cats' was such a documentary. The program followed a Facebook group that was formed when one of Canadas infamous murder posted a series of online cat killings.  This triggered the Facebook group to start a members crusade in order to catch the perpetrator before it led to a human murder.<div class=""></div></p><br>
